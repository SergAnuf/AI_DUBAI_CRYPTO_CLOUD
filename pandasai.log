About Tilal City
Integrated Community • Sustainable Living • Modern Lifestyle
Tilal City is a mixed-use development in the Emirate of Sharjah. It&#39;s a joint venture between Eskan Real Estate Development and the government&#39;s investment arm, Sharjah Asset Management. The world-class project covers an area of approximately 25 million square feet and is designed to accommodate 65,000 residents.


The properties available for sale in Tilal City include residential and commercial plots of land, villas, townhouses, and apartments. Tilal City offers investors a unique opportunity to buy or lease land and build properties in Sharjah. The plots in the development are freehold for all nationalities, and in 2014, Tilal City was the first to offer 100-year leaseholds for non-Arabs in Sharjah.
